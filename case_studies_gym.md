### Client Overview
A small local gym generating 200 leads per month but struggling to convert them into trial bookings. The owner had no follow-up system after leads submitted a form.

---

### Problem
- Leads went cold after signup
- No automated follow-up
- Lost sales opportunities every week

---

### Solution
I implemented:
- 7-day automated follow-up email sequence
- Personalized trial booking CTA inside each email
- Lead tracking using Google Sheets
**Tools Used:** Make.com + Gmail + Google Sheets
