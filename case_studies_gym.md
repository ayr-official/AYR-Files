**Service:** Lead Nurturing Automation  
**Client Type:** Local Gym  
**Date:** January 2025

### Client Overview
A small local gym generating 200 leads per month but struggling to convert them into trial bookings. The owner had no follow-up system after leads submitted a form.

---

### Problem
- Leads went cold after signup
- No automated follow-up
- Lost sales opportunities every week

---

### Solution
I implemented:
- 7-day automated follow-up email sequence
- Personalized trial booking CTA inside each email
- Lead tracking using Google Sheets
**Tools Used:** Make.com + Gmail + Google Sheets

---

### Results
| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Trial bookings | 8/month | 23/month |
| Lead response rate | 12% | 34% |
| Time saved weekly | 0 hrs | 5 hrs |

### Client Feedback
